### Concept

Let's say you have a modern single page web application with client-side URL
routing (e.g. Backbone).

Since views are rendered on the client, you'll likely use RESTful Express routes
that handle a single concern and return only JSON back to the client. The app's
only non-JSON endpoint is likely the index route (`/`).

So while `/users` might return a JSON array when hit via the client app's AJAX
call, you'll want to handle that request differently if the user clicks a link
from an external site or manually types it in the address bar. When hit in this
context, this middleware internally redirects the request to the index route
handler, so the same client-side app is loaded for every valid route. The URL
for the end user remains the same and the client-side app uses its own router to
show the user what's been requested based on the route. This eliminates the
tedium of performing this kind of conditional logic within individual route
callbacks.

### Installation
```
$ npm install --save express-spa-router
```

### Usage

In your Express app's configuration, place this middleware high up the stack
(before `router` and `static`) and pass it your app instance:

```javascript
app.use(require('express-spa-router')(app));
```

AJAX requests will be untouched, but valid routes called without AJAX will
result in the the index route's result being returned. Non-matching routes will
be passed down the stack by default and will be end up being handled by whatever
your app does with 404s. This can be overridden by passing a `noRoute` function
in the options object:

```javascript
app.use(require('express-spa-router')(app,
  {
    noRoute: function(req, res, next) {
      //handle unmatched route
    }
  }
));
```

Express's default static paths are passed along correctly by default (as are
`/js` and `/css`), but if you use different paths or have additional static
files in your `public` directory, make sure to specify them in the options
either via a regular expression or an array of directory names:

```javascript
app.use(require('express-spa-router')(app, {staticPaths: ['js', 'css', 'uploads']}));
```

You may also have valid client-side routes that don't exist on the server-side.
Rather than having them reach the 404 handler, you can specify them in the
configuration options using `extraRoutes` and passing either a regular
expression or an array:

```javascript
app.use(require('express-spa-router')(app, {extraRoutes: ['about', 'themes']}));
```

Finally, if you want to route non-AJAX `GET` requests to certain routes normally,
pass paths in the `ignore` option:

```javascript
app.use(require('express-spa-router')(app, {ignore: ['api']}));
```
