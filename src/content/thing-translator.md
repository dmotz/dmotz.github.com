Thing Translator is an open-source app that demonstrates
the simplicity and charm of harnessing modern machine learning techniques --
namely, computer vision and natural language translation. You can watch a video
explaining how it works [here](https://aiexperiments.withgoogle.com/thing-translator).

It was built with some friends at Google Creative Lab as part of the
[A.I. Experiments](https://aiexperiments.withgoogle.com) series.
