Trystero manages a clandestine courier network that lets your appʼs users talk
directly with one another, encrypted and without a server middleman. In other
words, it gives you WebRTC without any server setup — painless P2P.

Peers are matchmade via various substrata of the net (BitTorrent, IPFS, etc.)
and Trystero provides a simple, clean API for advanced tricks like exchanging
large files, audio/video streams, and metadata.
